# Corona Virus Support Site

This website lists companies that have supported the general public in some way during the Corona Virus pandemic.

Select any company on the list and a description of how that company has contributed positively during the pandemic will appear.

Each user has the option to like or dislike any company they agree/disagree with being on the list.

The companies are listed in order of most to least liked. 

This calls a Java Spring backend api which can be found here: https://github.com/Samkray21/Corona-Virus-Website-Backend
